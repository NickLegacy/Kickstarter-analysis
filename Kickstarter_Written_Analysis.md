# Kickstarter Analysis

### Overview
The purpose of this project is to examine data that has been collected and entered into the Kickstarter datasheet. 

### Analysis
The Kickstarter datasheet has lots of data and pertains to lots of fields. This report narrows down the data and focuses on 2 main areas of study. The first area focuses on Theater outcomes by launch date. The data collected is from the years of 2009 until 2017. The data is presented in chart form and shows the total amounts of successful, failed, and canceled outcomes per month. The second area of study comes from data based on goals. This data is also presented in chart form and it shows Successful and Failed outcomes based on percentage according to a set goal total. 

### Challenges
The biggest challenge encountered is how to explain misleading data. The data presented is in chart form, however, in this form alone the data can be misleading. To get a better understanding of the results, the data collected would need to be further broken down and include extra charts. 



### Theater Results by Launch Date

Theater reached it's highest levels of success during the warm weather months of May, June, and July. Success stayed consistent for the remaining months of the year with the exception of December, which saw a significant drop. Theater also experienced more successful outcomes than failures, in every single month, including December. Failed outcomes were less frequent during the cold weather months of November, December, and January. Cancelations were consistently low for the entire year, with October having no cancelations on record. 


### Outcomes based on Goals

Data shows that the best chances for success are when the goals total is low. As the goal total continues to rise, there is a sharp decline in the percentage of success. This downward trend stays consistent until around 35,000 total outcomes. At this time the percentage of success greatly increases, until it drops to zero at a goal of 45,000. Anything greater than a goal of 50,000 has only a 12.5% success rate. 

### Summary of Limitations
The dataset for Theater Outcomes by Launch date does have some limitations. The data consists of all years combined starting from 2009. What the data does not show is how theater has done yearly. A bar or column chart showing outcome results by year might be of more useful in showing whether outcomes are increasing in success in recent years. If you look at individual years however, there are some years that have very limited data. 2011 for example only has 4 total successful outcomes for the entire year, with zero failures. The outcomes based on goal chart also has some limitations because the chart is based on percentages. The chart shows a strong percentage decline in successful projects until the 35,000 goal level. At 35,000 the success percentage rate soars back up to 66% based on the chart. Unfortunately, there were only 6 total projects with 4 being successful, which makes the chart very misleading. A bar chart showing total success and total failed would have been a better option.
