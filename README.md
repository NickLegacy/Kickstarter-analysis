## Results

### Theater Results by Launch Date

Theater reached it's highest levels of success during the warm weather months of May, June, and July. Success stayed consistent for the remaining months of the year with the exception of December, which saw a significant drop. Theater also experienced more succesful outcomes than failures, in every single month, including December. Failed outcomes were less frequent during the cold weather months of November, December, and January. Cancelations were consistantly low for the entire year, with October having no cancelations on record. 


### Outcomes based on Goals

Data shows that the best chances for success are when the outcomes total is low. As the total number of outcomes continues to rise, there is a sharp decline in the percentage of success. This downward trend stays consistant until around 35,000 total outcomes. At this time the percentage of success greatly increases, until it drops to zero at 45,000 outcomes. Anything greater than 50,000 outcomes, has only a 12.5% success rate. 

### Summary of Limitations
The dataset for Theater Outcomes by Launch date does have some limitations. The data consists of all years combined starting from 2009. What the data does not show is how theater has done yearly. A bar or column chart showing outcome results by year might be of more useful in showing whether outcomes are increasing in sucess in recent years. If you look at individual years however, there are some years that have very limited data. 2011 for example only has 4 total successful outcomes for the entire year, with zero failures. The outcomes based on goal chart also has some limitations becaused the chart is based on percentages. The chart shows a strong percentage decline in succesful projects until the 35,000 goal level. At 35,000 the sucess percentage rate soars back up to 66% based on the chart. Unfortunately, there were only 6 total projects with 4 being successful, which makes the chart very misleading. A bar chart showing total sucess and total failed might have been a better option.
