Theater reached it's highest levels of success during the warm weather months of May, June, and July. Success stayed consistent for the remaining months of the year with the exception of December, which saw a significant drop. Theater also experienced more succesful outcomes than failures, in every single month, including December. Failed outcomes were less frequent during the cold weather months of November, December, and January. Cancelations were consistantly low for the entire year, with October having no cancelations on record. 


### Outcomes based on Goals

Data shows that the best chances for success are when the outcomes total is low. As the total number of outcomes continues to rise, there is a sharp decline in the percentage of success. This downward trend stays consistant until around 35,000 total outcomes. At this time the percentage of success greatly increases, until it drops to zero at 45,000 outcomes. Anything greater than 50,000 outcomes, has only a 12.5% success rate.
